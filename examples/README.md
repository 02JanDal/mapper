The examples to be edited are stored in the src subdirectory in the verbose
.xmap format. The examples to be distributed are stored in the more compact
.omap format in this subdirectory. The test subdirectory builds (under CMake)
an executable (test) `symbol_set_t` which updates compressed files from a list
of known files in the src directory.
