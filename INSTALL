== Installation on Windows ==

Requirements:
Qt, cmake and a C++ compiler.

The easiest way to get Qt is to intall the Qt SDK. The program is known to work with Qt 4.8.
When this is done, run cmake (I used the GUI version) and point it to the directory in which
CMakeLists.txt (and the file you are reading now) are in.
You can choose the build directory freely, but it is convenient to use a new subdirectory in this folder.

Then click "Configure". For me, it aborted saying that QMake cannot be found. In this case, enter its path
in the red line for the "QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE" key, for example "C:/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.8.0/msvc2010/bin/qmake.exe".
Click "Configure" again and it should run through. Because "Generate" was not enabled yet, I had to click "Configure"
a third time and then finally "Generate".

This generates the build files in the directory you specified earlier. If you use MinGW, you should now be able to
run "make" in this directory, though I have not tried it - feedback on that is welcome! Instead, I used Visual C++ 2010.
In this case, a *.sln file is generated in the build directory which should be opened as the next step.

Three projects should be visible in the Solution Explorer which is by default on the left side. Right click the
"Mapper" project and choose "Set as StartUp project". Right click it again and choose "Properties".
Change "Configuration" to "All configurations" on the top left.
In Linker -> System, change "SubSystem" to Windows.
In Debugging, change "Working directory" to the bin subdirectory. If you created the build directory
as a subdirectory of that containing CMakeLists.txt, you can use "$(ProjectDir)..\bin" (without the ").
If you want to run the Debug version, set the configuration to Debug, go to C/C++ -> Code Generation and
set "Runtime Library" to "Multi-threaded Debug DLL". If you forget that, everything will seem to run well, but you will
encounter strange crashes on QList destructors. You may also want to disable optimizations for the debug version.

Finally, build and run the program.


== Installation on Linux ==

Requirements:
Qt, cmake and a C++ compiler.

The program is known to work with Qt 4.7 and 4.8 and not to compile with Qt 4.4 or earlier.
Information about other versions is not available, feel free to give feedback about them.

Building:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -jX        (where X is the number of threads for building)

Running:
cd ../bin       (if still in the build directory)
./Mapper -graphicssystem raster

The option "-graphicssystem raster" is a Qt option which usually leads to better performance,
in case it is not the default anyway.
