== Installation on Linux ==

Requirements:
Qt, cmake and a C++ compiler.

The program is known to work with Qt 4.7 and not to compile with Qt 4.4 or earlier.
Information about other versions is not available, feel free to give feedback about them.

Building:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -jX        (where X is the number of threads for building)

Running:
cd ../bin       (if still in the build directory)
./Mapper -graphicssystem raster

The option "-graphicssystem raster" is a Qt option which usually leads to better performance,
in case it is not the default anyway.
