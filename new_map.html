<h3>Begin a New map</h3>
<p>There are two important choices to be made before commencing a new map. These are the scale of the map and the symbol set to be employed. While either of these can be altered at a later time, that is sometimes difficult and it is better to take the trouble to decide on the scale and the map standard before beginning. OOMapper presents a dialog box to set these important parameters before you start.</p>
<p class="label">Scale</p>
<p>Map scales are set in accordance with the International Standard for Orienteering Maps (ISOM). The traditional competition format is at 1:15000. More recently maps may be printed at 1:10000 for shorter courses. Maps at 1:10k are visually identical to those at 1:15k.  The ISOM emphatically requires that a larger scale 1:10k shall not be used in order to fit more detail onto the map but simply permits the map to be more easily read by older competitors. Sprint maps made to the ISSOM standard may be at either 1:5000 or 1:4000 and use a different symbol set appropriate to that scale.</p>
<p>Printing of a map prepared at 1:15000 may be at either scale (and conversely a map prepared at 1:10k can be printed at 1:15k) with no loss of accuracy or information. Most course planning software provides for this re-scaling at the point of printing.</p>
<p>The ISOM details the size, shape and use of all the permitted symbols and codes on the map, and these are the only acceptable symbols and sizes on a map to be printed at a scale of 1:15000.  If it is desired to prepare a map at a scale of 1:10000 (or some other scale) a new symbol set appropriate to that scale would need to be created with proportionately larger symbols.  There seems little point to this.</p>
<p>Do not confuse this with the scale of fieldwork which is sensibly at a much larger scale than the finished map.  Fieldwork is rescaled to the scale of the map when it is loaded as a <a href="templates.html">template</a>.</p>
<p>Using a larger scale (1:10k) for the map with symbol sizes appropriate to a smaller scale (1:15k) provides more white space and enables more detail to be included but this is at the expense of readability, and the additional detail is almost always unnecessary and thus unhelpful.  The resulting map does not conform to the international standard and is not suitable for competition.</p>
<p class="label">Symbol set</p>
<p>In conjunction with the scale it is necessary to make an early decision on the symbol set to be used. Again this is determined by the mapping standard adopted. Maps prepared in conformity with the ISOM will use only the standard symbols of the ISOM symbol set. It is important to resist the invention of other sybmols for local features as these local uses erode the international uniformity which enables competitors from any country or language to use the map in fair competition. Non-conforming local map standards also create confusion for local competitors entering an event on maps conforming to the ISOM.</p>
<p>Having set these basic parameters we can now pick the button to <a href="map_screen.html"><button type="button">Create</button></a> the new map.</p>
