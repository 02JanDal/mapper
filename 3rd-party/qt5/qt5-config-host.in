# sh wrapping:
# Especially MSYS needs -l so that it reads /etc/profile and sets up a proper
# environment. But /etc/profile will cd to the home directory. The wrapper needs
# to cd back to the BINARY_DIR. [2]
# In addition, configure must be called from its proper /[DRIVER_LETTER]/...
# path in MSYS, while CMAKE provides a [DRIVE_LETTER]:/... path. [1]

# [1] Get rid of DOS-style paths in MSYS
