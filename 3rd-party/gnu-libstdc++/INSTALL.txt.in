For building and installing libstdc++ and for creating the source package, you
need to have installed the matching Android NDK release (cf. NDK-Release.txt)
and run:

   ./build.sh /PATH/TO/NDK

You may add options as understood by the NDK's build-gnu-libstdc++.sh, e.g.
--verbose or -j6.


ATTENTION:
Before running build.sh, you need to backup (if desired) and remove
/PATH/TO/NDK/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/4.9 which come with the NDK.
The build process will write new libstdc++ files to this directory!


The source code in the src subdirectory was taken from

  https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/gcc.git

The selected git revision is documented in the file REVISION.

The build scripts and patches in the build/tools/ directory were taken from the
Android NDK release's directory build/tools/. The gcc patches in
build/tools/toolchain-patches/ were already applied to the source code in src
and are included in this distribution for reference
