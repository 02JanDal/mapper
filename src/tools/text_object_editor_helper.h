/**
 * Helper class editing the text of TextObject.
 * 
 * This class is meant to be used by tools (DrawTextTool, EditPointTool) in the
 * following way:
 * 
 *  - When text editing starts, the tool must construct an object of this class.
 *    The constructor takes care of modifying the state of the main window.
 *  - Then the tool must pass all mouse and key events through this object,
 *    call draw() etc. The object will emit a signal for state changes which
 *    need a redraw of the output and another signal when editing is finished.
 *  - When editing is finished, the tool must destroy the object. The destructor
 *    will restore the original state of the main window.
