<h4>Templates</h4>
<p>Accurate mapping depends on high quality fieldwork. Ordinarily, fieldwork will usually produce a paper sketch with all the detail required to produce the map but often marked up with shorthand codes which are meaningful to the mapper but which will not appear on the finished map. Instead of paper the mapper may use mylar or other robust drafting film. Fieldworking on transparent film also permits the use of an underlay which may have a coordinate grid or an old map visible underneath (at an appropriate scale).</p>
<p>The fieldwork will usually be done at a larger scale than the final map. With convenient rescaling of computer graphic images it is now possible for fieldwork to be undertaken at any convenient scale such as 1:5000 or even larger. This demands less skill in field penmanship than the traditional fieldwork scale of 1:7500.</p>
<p>The fieldwork is scanned &#8212; about 200dpi is usually quite sufficient resolution &#8212; now save the image as a .png file in your map file directory ( .jpg image files also work). This file is then loaded as a template underneath the new map screen and the features are inserted on the map on top of the fieldwork image. The fieldwork must be scaled and positioned appropriately for this purpose.</p>

<h4>Opening and scaling</h4>
<p>Selecting a .png or .jpg image file as a template will open a scaling dialog for that file. There are two options for scaling: setting a calculated value of metres per pixel, or a scan dpi and fieldwork scale values.  This needs to be done accurately.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your fieldwork image covers 500m width on the ground and the image is scanned at 1200 pixels wide then the scale will be 500 / 1200 = 0.625 metres per pixel. (Take care that the number of metres corresponds exactly the width of the image file.)</li>
<li>Alternatively if your fieldwork is at a known scale (it should be &#8212; say 1:5000), and the scan is at a chosen resolution (say 200dpi) then these parameters may be entered to accurately scale the fieldwork image &#8212; with no need to know the precise width of either fieldwork or the image.  (In this example if the fieldwork is 6" wide the scanned image at 200dpi will be 1200 pixels wide and at 1:5000 will cover 762m on the ground: 5000 * 6" = 2500' * 0.3048 = 762m)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Positioning</h4>
<p>This involves both location on the map and correct rotation of the image.  Mark several (at least 3) pass points on your fieldwork for which you know the required map location.  These can be arbitrary grid locations and should be located in areas without other detail.  Having loaded the fieldwork at the correct scale (see above) in the template setup window open the Georeferencing dialog box.</p>
<p>Select "New" pass point, then on the fieldwork image pick the first pass point (it will be marked with a red +).  Move the mouse to the coordinates at which this pass point should lie, and pick again (this map location will be marked with a green +).  A line of data will appear in the dialog box showing the values entered and the two points picked between the fieldwork and the map will be joined by a thin red line.  Repeat this for each of your remaining pass points.</p>
<p>When all the pass points have been linked tick the box "Apply pass points" and your fieldwork will move to the position giving the minimum error.  The actual error for each passpoint will be shown on the dialog box.  If this result is unsatisfactory either edit the passpoints (use the "Move" tool above the table to adjust the position of either end of any tie) or clear the passpoints and try again.  Zoom in close to place the pass points accurately.</p>

<h4>Closing a template</h4>
<p>Pick the template to be closed and then pick "Delete" on the template setup window.</p>

<h4>Multiple templates</h4>
<p>There are usually many sheets of fieldwork to cover the area of a map. It is often desirable to be able to have several of these visible in the work space at the same time, so that features which start on one fieldwork area and continue on the adjacent sheet can be conveniently mapped as a single feature. If the template images are accurately scaled and positioned then work should be able to proceed seamlessly across multiple sheets.</p>
<p>It is often useful also to have an arial or satellite photo image as a template. Again that must be scanned at an appropriate resolution and then rescaled and positioned to suit the drawing. It is possible to load several different images as backgrounds simultaneously. Transparency may be set for the upper templates so that the lower images are visible underneath, however if there is too much overlapping detail the result may be congested and difficult to use. It is often simpler to use only one template at a time.  Moving the required template to the top with transparency at zero achieves this without unloading the others.  This is important as when templates are unloaded the position, scale and orientation information is lost.</p>
