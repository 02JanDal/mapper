<h4>Drawing Toolbar</h4>
<p>Toolbars may be moved to a more convenient position.  To detach and move, pick the handle (the vertical line of dots) at the left end and drag the toolbar to your preferred position.  The resulting order of your tools may thus be different from this page.</p>

<a name="zoom_all"><p class="label">Show whole map tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/view-show-all.png" width="32" height="32" border="0" alt="" />Use this tool to display the whole map on your screen.  This can be particularly useful when items are accidently moved far from your working area and out of sight.  This tool brings it onscreen - if your map is just a dot in one corner then the rogue feature is near the other edge of the screen.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="selector"><p class="label">Object selector and edit tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-edit.png" width="32" height="32" border="0" alt="" />Pick to select this tool, then on the map to highlight a single symbol.  Symbols are defined within a rectangle which surrounds them.  A large symbol such as a long contour line will be surrounded by a large rectangle which may cover a significant area of the map.  If the symbol you wish is not selected with the first pick, move the mouse slightly and pick again.  To select multiple features hold the shift key as you pick subsequent items. If you pick on an item which has been already been selected the pick will deselect that item.</p>
<p>Point features may be moved using this tool.  Pick on the feature to highlight it, then pick and hold while moving the mouse to drag it to a preferred position.</p>
<p>Line features may also be edited.  Pick on the line to highlight it.  The nodes defining the line will become visible as small squares with two control points defining the tangent.  Hovering the pointer over one of these will cause it to change to a yellow color.  The point can then be picked and dragged to a preferred position.  The control points can also be edited by picking and dragging - as the control arm is made longer the influence of that control increases.  Moving the control point laterally changes the direction at the tangent point.</p>
<p>Ctrl-selection of multiple objects appears to not work at this time.  A group of objects may also be selected by drawing a selection box with a left-pick and drag. The selection box must include at least one node in each item for the item to be included.  Improvements required.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="point"><p class="label">Set point objects tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/draw-point.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool enables you to insert a point symbol from the map symbol window.  This includes a boulder, rocky ground, knoll, waterhole or any other symbol representing a point feature too small to be drawn to scale.  Select the symbol for the feature to be inserted by picking it on the symbol window, pick the point tool and then pick on the map to insert that feature on the map. These features may subsequently be moved using the object selector and edit tool.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="line"><p class="label">Path and Line tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/draw-path.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">The path and line tool draws line features such as contour lines, buildings (outlines) and roads.  Choose the symbol for the feature to be inserted by picking it on the symbol set, then pick the line tool and then pick on the map at the starting point for the line.  At each subsequent pick along the line a vertex will be created.  To finish the line double click or right click.  To create a smooth curve click-&-hold as you draw the mouse away in the continuing direction &#8212; this creates a tangent point with two control points which may be subsequently used to intuitively refine the shape of the curve.  For straight line segments release the mouse button and pick only at vertices.  Double click or right click to finish the line. </p>

<a name="closedbdy"><p>To draw a closed path (perimeter of an area feature such as a building, parking lot or a lake) press the return key to close the last segment of the path to the starting point.</a> A filled area can be drawn using the line tool having selected an area symbol for the tool to use.</p>
<p>To remove a misplaced point use the backspace key to undo, or leave it and correct the position using the edit feature.  If the partly drawn line is discovered to be a mistake use 'escape' key to abort and remove it entirely.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="text"><p class="label">Text tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/draw-text.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool enables text to be placed on the drawing.  In order to be language-independent orienteering maps generally do not have names or text information on features.  The text tool is useful for map titles and version numbers etc.  It is necessary to select a text symbol (which determines the font etc.) before the text tool will become available.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="template"><p class="label">Template markup tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/pencil.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool enables the freehand drawing of lines, annotation and erasure on the template image loaded behind the map, in a choice of 8 colors.  Find notes on <a href="templates.html">Templates here</a>.</p>
<p>Pick and hold the left mouse button to draw while the mouse is moved.  Hold the right mouse button as the mouse is moved to erase.  This markup is saved on your template image &#8212; as the template image file is permanently altered it would be good practice to keep a copy of the template file in another directory.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="duplicate"><p class="label">Duplicator </p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-duplicate.png" width="32" height="32" border="0" />This tool creates a duplicate of any selected object.  Select the object then pick the tool to create an identical second symbol in the same place.  The duplicate is created in the same place, so the appearance of the map does not immediately change.  However, the duplicate can be selected and dragged to another location leaving the other behind.  To drag a selected symbol pick and hold on the line of the enclosing box and drag as required.  This tool is useful when applied to create and move identical groups of items.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="change"><p class="label">Switch symbol</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-switch-symbol.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">Sometimes it is desired to change one symbol to another.  Select the symbol (feature) to change on the map, then select the target symbol in the symbol window.  Pick on the tool and the map symbol will change to the target symbol - provided that the target symbol is of the same type as the map symbol (ie both must be either point, line, or area features.)</p><br clear=all />

<a name="fill"><p class="label">Fill tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-fill-border.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">Having drawn a <a href="drawing_toolbar.html#closedbdy">closed boundary</a> which requires a fill (such as an uncrossable marsh or a building) select the boundary on the map (use the Object Selector tool), then choose the required fill symbol in the symbols window.  A left pick on the fill tool will put the chosen fill into the selected boundary.  If there is already a fill there, the boundary will have two fills.  This is a similar function to the duplicator tool.  A filled area can also be drawn using the line tool having selected an area symbol for the tool to use.  If the symbol selected has a boundary then the boundary will also be drawn.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="reverse"><p class="label">Reversing tool - Switch direction</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-switch-dashes.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool changes the direction of any line symbol drawn in the wrong direction.  Thus an impassable cliff drawn in one direction will have the tags projecting correctly (to the 'down' side), but drawn starting from the other end the tags will appear on the wrong side.  This tool fixes the problem.  Highlight the symbol on the map then pick the tool.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="connect"><p class="label">Connect paths and lines tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-connect-paths.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool enables two lines (paths) to be joined together to create a single line or path.  </p><p>It is necessary that the ends to be joined are very close together &#8212; less than 0.3mm apart.  Select one path using the object selector tool then holding the shift key select the second path: both paths should now appear to be enclosed by a single box.  A single left pick on the connect tool will join the ends together.  It may be necessary to adjust the position and direction of the node at the join.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="cut"><p class="label">Cut lines and areas</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-cut.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool will cut an existing line or path feature into two parts.  Select the path to be cut with the object selector tool then select the cut tool and pick at the point where it is desired to break the line.  Two additional end points will be added (one for each part of the line) at that point.</p>
<p>To cut an area feature it is necessary to start and end the cut line on the boundary of the area to be cut.  It is not sufficient to cross the boundary; both ends of the line must be on the boundary within a very small tolerance.  The cut line may be crooked or curved with any number of vertices.  The cut occurs immediately when the line is finished on the boundary (with a double pick) so there is no opportunity to edit the cut line. </p><br clear=all />

<a name="cut_hole"><p class="label">Cut holes tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-cut-hole.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool will cut a hole in an area feature.  Select the feature with the object selector tool then pick the cut holes tool.  On the area feature pick to describe the boundary of the required hole and after the final node press enter or right-pick to close.  The hole will appear immediately.  The boundary of the hole may then be edited in the same way as any line.  If the line describing the hole crosses the boundary of the feature the area outside the former boundary and inside the "hole" will be filled with feature symbol.</p><br clear=all />

<a name="rotate"><p class="label">Rotate tool</p></a>
<p><img class=small src="images/tool-rotate.png" width="32" height="32" border="0">This tool will rotate any group of selected features (which can include the whole map) about a selected pivot point and by any angle.  Select the item(s) to be rotated using the object selector tool, then pick the rotate tool.  Next pick on the map at the point about which the rotation is to occur (the rotation centre) &#8212; this will be marked with a small circle.  If it is desired that the feature symbol does not move significantly place the rotation centre in the middle of the symbol.  Now pick a point at a convenient radius from the rotation centre and move the selected items about the rotation centre to the desired position.</p>
<p>If it is desired to rotate the selected features through some precise angle construct a guide with two intersecting lines at the required angle and put the rotation centre at their vertex.  It is simple to use EditMenu/Undo (or ctrl-z) to undo any rotation, and to then select a different rotation centre to get an improved result.</p><br clear=all />
