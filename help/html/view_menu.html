<a name="zoom"><h4>Scale and Zoom</h4></a>
<p>The scale at which the map will be printed was set before drawing started.  The scale at which it appears on the screen is not related to the printing scale.  Zoom in by rolling the middle scroll wheel of your mouse (or repeated F7 keystrokes) to make the image as large as convenient to permit very precise placement and adjustment of features.  The zoom indicator near the bottom right corner of your screen shows approximately the current magnification of your map image.</p>

<p>Sometimes if there appears to be no map image at all, it may be that you are zoomed in so close that the screen is filled with white space.  Zoom out for a broader view - this changes nothing on your map.  As you zoom in, hover the mouse over the feature you wish to see more precisely so that it stays in the visible area.</p>

<p>Move the map image around the window by pick-&-drag with the middle (scroll wheel) mouse button.  Users without a wheel mouse can move the map with the cursor keys.</p>

<a name="coords"><h4>Cursor position</h4></a>
<p>The coordinates of the cursor on the map are shown in the position box at the bottom right corner of your screen.  The position shown here is in millimetres (with an accuracy of 1/100 mm - 10 microns on the page and 0.15 m or 6" on the ground at 1:15k) right, and up, from the origin which is set when you place the first item on your drawing (placing that item gives it a physical location - choose it appropriately).  Locations below or left of that origin will have negative coordinates.  </p>

<p>The first symbol placed on the map fixes the position of the map image with respect to the cursor coordinates.  If planning to make your map fit a standard sheet of paper, it may be helpful to start with a rectangle (border) close to the edges of the sheet to help position your map on both the sheet and the coordinate system.  Set the bottom left corner of that rectangle at 0,0 and your coordinates will always be positive while you are inside the rectangle.  </p>

<p>Use of other coordinate systems (eg GPS) are planned but not yet implemented.</p>
