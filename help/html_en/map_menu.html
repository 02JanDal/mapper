<p>Map scales are set in accordance with the Internationsl Standard for Orienteering Maps (ISOM). The traditional competition format is at 1:15000. More recently maps may be printed at 1:10000 for shorter courses. Maps at 1:10k are visually identical to those at 1:15k.  The ISOM emphatically requires that a larger scale 1:10k shall not be used in order to fit more detail onto the map but simply permits the map to be more easily read by older competitors who will generally have shorter courses and not require large maps. Sprint maps made to the ISSOM standard may be at either 1:5000 or 1:4000 and use a different symbol set appropriate to that scale.</p>
<p>Printing of a map prepared at 1:15000 may be at either scale (and conversely a map prepared at 1:10k can be printed at 1:15k) with no loss of accuracy or information. Most course planning software provides for this re-scaling at the point of printing.</p>
<p>The ISOM details the size, shape and use of all the permitted symbols and codes on the map, and these are the only acceptable symbols and sizes on a map to be printed at a scale of 1:15000.  If it is desired to prepare the original map at a scale of 1:10000 (or some other scale) a new symbol set appropriate to that scale would need to be created with proportionately larger symbols.  There seems little point in this.</p>
<p>Do not confuse this with the scale of fieldwork which is sensibly at a larger scale than the finished map.  Fieldwork is rescaled to the scale of the map when it is loaded as a <a href="template_menu.html">template</a>.</p>
<p>Using a larger scale with symbol sizes appropriate to a smaller scale provides more white space and enables more detail to be included but this is at the expense of readability, and the additional detail is almost always unnecessary and thus unhelpful.</p>
