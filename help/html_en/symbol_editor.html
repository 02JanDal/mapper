<h3>Symbol Editor</h3>
<h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
<p>
The symbol editor enables any user to create new symbols or to modify any of the symbols provided in the default symbol set.  It should be understood that the default symbol set includes all the symbols permitted by the ISOM and that any new symbols created, or modifications of existing symbols, will be a departure from the international standard.</p>
<p>There is a temptation to employ a symbol which is used in other local cartography to represent some feature on the basis that everybody who competes in this area is familiar with the notation.  However, any such departure is confusing for a competitor who may be familiar with the international standard but not with your local notation.  Similarly a local competitor may find the conforming notation strange when entering international competition. Thus a non-standard notation can be to the disadvantage of both local and visiting competitors.</p>
<p>In Open Orienteering Mapper symbols are created only once, the icon on the symbol menu is created automatically from the symbol information.</p>
<h4>Editor</h4>
<p>The symbol editor is opened by a right-click on any symbol &#8212; the menu offers options to create a new item or to Edit the selected item. If creation of a new symbol is selected the menu presents a choice of a point, line, area, text or a combined symbol.</p>
<p>In each case the dialog opens with a General page which is the same for all symbols, and that is followed by pages specific to each type of symbol.  The General page is discussed (in the context of line features) <a href="#general">below</a>.</p>
<p>A <b>Point symbol</b> is a simple feature which may be comprised of circular features, line or area features.  Detail of how to create these may be <a href="#startsymbol">found below</a> (in the context of line features)</p>
<p>A <b>Line symbol</b> may be comprised of basic line features and also a variety of point features. Details of these are <a href="#startsymbol">found below</a>.</p>
<p>An <b>Area symbol</b> has an area settings page which provides a colour and a minimum size for the area.  There is also facility to add a line fill (a grid of lines) or pattern fill (an array of dots or other shapes) and the creation and editing of these is the same as for patterns in the context of line features <a href="#startsymbol">found below</a>.</p>
<p>A <b>Text symbol</b> is used to insert titles, a legend and other notes on the face of the map.  Text size and font may be set using the dialog.  Text size may be approximated as 0.24 times the point size for a typical easy to read font (but some fonts may depart significantly from this rule of thumb).  Thus 6pt font has a letter height of  6*0.24=1.44 mm.  Choosing an uncommon font may create problems for others opening the map on computer systems where this font is not installed.</p>
<p>A <b>Combined  symbol</b> is made up of two or more other symbol defined in the Symbol window.  The combination settings dialog requires the number of contributing symbols to be fixed and the contributing symbols to be identified (they must already exist).</p>

<h4>Line Editor</h4>
<p>The editor opens with a dialog panel on the left, and on the right is a graphic showing the appearance of the symbol as it is currently configured, in a variety of lengths and orientations.</p>

<p>The symbol editor dialog has up to six tabs providing access to pages on which the features of each symbol can be manipulated.</p>

<a name="general"><p class="label">General</p></a>
<p>This page allows entry and modification of the symbol number.  Numbering is specified in the ISOM and ISSOM.  The symbol should be given an appropriate name and the description panel may be used to show the ISOM conditions on the use of the symbol.  The description panel is made visible when a user presses the F1 key while hovering the mouse on the symbol in the symbols window.</p>

<p>At the foot of the dialog is a box which when checked identifies the symbol as being a helper &#8212; a component of another symbol and not to be used alone.  It is recommended that helper symbols are given numbers in the third subset (which is not used by ISOM).  Thus a helper for symbol number abc.d might be numbered abc.d.1</p>

<a name="symbol-type-2"><p class="label">Line settings</p></a>
<p><b>Line width</b> and <b>colour</b> define the basic line characteristics.  Minimum line length function is not yet implemented.   <b>Line cap</b> permits the shape of the end of the line to be specified.  <b>Line join</b> refers to the rendering of vertices where straight line sections join each other.</p>

<p><b>Dashed lines</b> are created by a tick in the dash box, which opens the dash dialog lines.  Typical length of dash and gap may be specified &#8212; these will be rendered with gaps of the specified size and dashes as close as practicable to the specified length (so that there is no fractional dash at the end).  The appearance of lines with regular symbols or breaks may be improved by making the end dash a half length &#8212; a check box provides for this.  Dashes may be grouped together with a specified gap within the groups which is different from the between-group gap length.</p>

<p>Many symbols (eg 520 Stone wall) have a <b>repeated feature</b> along the line.  This line feature is invoked by setting a non-zero integer number in the mid-symbol count.  The mid-symbol distance sets the spacing between symbol centres.  The distance between spots refers to the distance between symbol groups; if the mid-symbol distance is too large then the groups may overlap.  The distance from the end is an approximate length of line projecting beyond the last group. A check box to require at least one mid-symbol ensures that the line has at least one symbol but may give confusing results if the line is too short for meaningful rendering.  Setting a minimum mid-symbol count will prevent that but its effect is not yet implemented.  A different mid-symbol minimum may be specified for the boundary line of a closed symbol.</p>

<p>Some line symbols require an <b>outline</b> which is enabled by selecting the border check box.  Border width is the width (thickness) of the border lines.  Shift moves the border lines further apart &#8212; shift equal to half the width will place the line just outside the edge of the main line. A dash feature is enabled by the check box with characteristics which do not have to match the main line.</p>

<a name="startsymbol"><p class="label">Start symbol</p></a>
<p>The start symbol will appear only at the first-fixed end of the line.  This can be changed for a particular line with the <a href="drawing_toolbar.html#reverse">reversing tool</a>.  The start is the left end of the horizontal sample lines in the illustrative graphic to the right of the symbol editor.  The start symbol may be made of several elements.  To add an element click the + button at the bottom of the elements list.  To delete one click the - button.  An element may be a point (a circular element), a line or an area element.

<p>The default feature is a point element (line or area elements must be added).  <b>Point elements</b> have inner diameter and outer width which may be different colours, and will be centred on the beginning of the main line. </p>

<p>A <b>line element</b> has width, colour, end-shape and join characteristics specified in the current element dialog.  The line may have any shape defined by successive pairs of coordinates, add more coordinate pairs with the + button at the bottom of the coordinates window and delete them with the - button. The origin is the beginning point of the symbol line, the X axis is positive in the direction of the main symbol line, and the Y axis is up the screen.  Curved lines are created by constructing a shape with straights and then clicking the check box to make some parts curves.  Better results may be obtained with curves which do not bend more than 90 degrees.</p>

<p>An <b>area element</b> has a colour and a shape specified in the current element dialog.  The shape of the area is defined by successive pairs of coordinates, add more coordinate pairs with the + button at the bottom of the coordinates window and delete them with the - button. The origin is the beginning point of the symbol line, the X axis is positive in the direction of the main symbol line, and the Y axis is up the screen.    Curved edges are created by constructing a shape with straights and then clicking the check box to make some parts curves.  Better results may be obtained with curves which do not bend more than 90 degrees.</p>

<a name="midsymbol"><p class="label">Mid symbol</p></a>
<p>These symbols appear along the line at the spacing set for mid-symbols in the 'line settings' dialog.  Again they may be point, line or area elements.  Other details for these are similar to those for start symbols (above).</p>

<a name="endsymbol"><p class="label">End symbol</p></a>
<p>This symbol appears only at the last-fixed end of the symbol line.  This can be changed for a particular line with the <a href="drawing_toolbar.html#reverse">reversing tool</a>.  The end symbol will appear at the right end of the of the horizontal sample lines in the illustrative graphic to the right of the symbol editor.  The symbol may be made of several elements.  To add an element click the + button at the bottom of the elements list.  An element may be a point (a circular element), a line or an area element.  Other details for these are similar to those for start symbols (above).</p>

<a name="dashsymbol"><p class="label">Dash symbol</p></a>
<p>This symbol will appear at switched nodes along a line for which the symbol is active.  The presence (or absence) of the symbol is toggled with the space bar &#8212; the symbol will appear at each node drawn while the helpful tip at the bottom edge shows "<b>Dash points on.</b>" This switch may vary from point to point along the line.   The symbol may be made of several elements.  To add an element click the + button at the bottom of the elements list.  An element may be a point (a circular element), a line or an area element.  Other details for these are similar to those for start symbols (above).</p>
